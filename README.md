# Introduction

This document is the primary reference for the [Lean](http://leanprover.github.io/)
programming language.

It focuses on providing:
- Informal explanations of the language and its use.
- A formal presentation of Lean's meta theory and axioms.
- A description of the languages runtime, async proof checking ...

This document is not intended to be an
[introduction](https://leanprover.github.io/introduction_to_lean) to the language.
We provide separate books intended to for most users of Lean, one focused on
[theorem proving](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean) and
another on [programming](https://leanprover.github.io/programming_in_lean) with Lean.

This document only covers the minimal library details needed by Lean,
the standard library is documented separately, with the hope of using
`leandoc` to extract and host documentation elsewhere in the future.
